# Editor Preview Workflow

This guide explains how to use the preview functionality in Sanity Studio to see draft content on the live website before publishing.

## Overview

The preview system allows content editors to:

- View draft content in the actual website layout
- See changes immediately without publishing
- Iterate on content with real-time feedback
- Collaborate on draft content with stakeholders

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open a document** in Sanity Studio (blog post or directory item)
2. **Make your edits** and save as draft
3. **Click the "Preview" button** in the toolbar (eye icon)
4. **Review your content** in the website with the yellow preview banner
5. **Exit preview** when done or publish your changes

## üìù Step-by-Step Workflow

   - Make your changes to title, content, images, etc.
